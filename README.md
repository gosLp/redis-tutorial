# Tutorial for redis with typescript for College

This is just a demo showcasing simple usecases of redis db


## INSTALLATION

# windows
Redis doesn't really support windows unless you use an old archieved version
instead you'll need a Linux subsystem like WSL or WSL2 which is likely already installed on your windows 11 or 10 device.

in your Linux subsystem
Install Redis 

**For Example Ubuntu WSL2**
```
{
    sudo apt-get install redis
}
```

this will install redis-server and redis-cli as well

in a separate terminal you can now run redis-server and redis-cli

Use redis-cli to query the redis db

# Macos or Linux type Os:
# As a cache store


# As a session store
